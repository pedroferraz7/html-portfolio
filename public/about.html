<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! 
  I'm Pedro Ferraz, a 25-year-old adventurer passionate about languages, technology, and exploring diverse cultures. Originally from Brazil, I've had the privilege of calling London and Lisbon home, enriching my life with experiences and connections from different corners of the world. </p>
  <p>My journey has been defined by my love for languages. Fluent in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, I thrive on the ability to communicate and connect with people from various backgrounds. Living in London for nearly three years and Lisbon for a year and a half broadened my perspective and deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity.</p>
  <p>Currently, I'm immersing myself in the exciting world of coding, eager to unlock its potential and contribute to the digital landscape. As I navigate this new terrain, I'm fueled by curiosity, determination, and a thirst for knowledge.</p>
  <p>Join me on this exhilarating journey as I embrace challenges, celebrate victories, and strive to make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving realm of technology.
  <p>Let's connect and explore together!</p> </br>
